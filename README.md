I'm an Australian front-end web developer and designer, dabbling in back-end and game development occasionally.

I'm Currently working on [ambience.css](https://github.com/Ambience-Studios/ambience.css). A simple, lightweight frontend framework.

I like [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).
