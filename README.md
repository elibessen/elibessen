I'm an Australian front-end web developer and designer, dabbling in back-end and game development occasionally.

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic) with a Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Science.

I'm not really working on anything at the moment.

I like [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).
